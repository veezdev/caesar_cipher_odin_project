# Caesar Cipher

This project is a simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher algorithm in Ruby.

## Description

The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on.

This project provides a Ruby script that encrypts and decrypts strings using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/caesar_cipher_odin_project.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd caesar_cipher_odin_project`
3. Install the required gems: `bundle install`

## Usage

To encrypt a string, run the following command:

```shell
ruby main.rb <string> <shift>
